      <h2>
        Comparing race to types of force levels used by CPD:
      </h2>
  
      <p>
        We created the pivot table by selecting all data to begin with. Then, we selected the SUB_RACE column for the table's rows.
        With this data, we filtered out all unknown/other values since it was negligible and not relevant to our table.
        For the columns of this pivot table, we selected level of force. This chart specifically illustrates Level 1 force by race,
        but it can be edited to show any level, 1-4. Lastly, we set the values as SUB_RACE, since we wanted to quantify the level
        force used by race.

      <h2>
        Relating police reports by race to Chicago Communities:
      </h2>

      <p>
        We followed a similar process as described above for this pivot table. 
        The idea of this dataset was not to just highlight that Black people are 
        disproportionately burdened by police violence in Chicago - this is well known. 
        We wanted to illustrate this next to a race-by-community chart, to see if 
        there are specific wards where certain races/ethnicities are targeted in 
        contrast to the majority racial/ethnic demographic of the communities. 
        Unfortunately, we were unable to find a dataset on the Chicago Data Portal that 
        broke down race/ethnicity via community boundaries. We added a color tracker to
        clearly illustrate which neighborhoods have higher incidences.
