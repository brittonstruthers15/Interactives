<h2>Get to know my journalism</h2>


<p>Hi there! I am a reporter with the Medill News Service at Northwestern University, a freelance journalist, and a photographer. 
    My published work includes news articles, live broadcasts, and a documentary. She began her career as an Assistant Producer 
    in the United Kingdom, and travelled around the world working on live TV. 
    Prior to that, Struthers-Lugo graduated from the University of St Andrews in Scotland with an MA 
    in Film Studies and International Relations. Last but not least, she is a proud Puerto Rican. Â¡Wepa!</p>
