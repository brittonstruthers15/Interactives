        President Elect Donald Trump says he wishes to purchase Greenland from 
        Denmark, acquire Canada as the 51st state and control the Panama Canal.

        According to
        <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_territorial_acquisitions#:~:text=The%20country's%20first%20and%20largest,acquisitions%2C%20as%20of%20August%202021.">data from Ballotpedia</a>,
        the United States' last land acquisition was the Marshall Islands 
        in 1947 via cession. The last land purchase was more than a century ago, 
        when the U.S. bought the Virgin Islands from Denmark for $25 million. Below is a list of the
        United States' historical land acquisitions via purchase, starting with the most recent. 
      </p>
       <ul>
        <li>Virgin Islands, 1917</li>
        <li>Philippine Islands, 1898 </li>
        <li>Alaska, 1867</li>
        <li>Gadsgen Purchase, 1853</li>
        <li>Mexican Cession, 1848</li>
        <li>Florida Purchase, 1819</li>
        <li>Louisiana Purchase, 1803</li>
      </ul>
  
      <p>
        While Donald Trump said that he would rely on economic coercion to acquire the land, he also said that he would not rule out using force to acquire Greenland and the Panama Canal.
